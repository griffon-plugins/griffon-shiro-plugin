---
http://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro, window="_blank"] is a powerful and easy-to-use Java
security framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography, and session management.

This plugin enables access control on controller actions via a set of annotations.
Security checks will be performed before an action is invoked. Annotated actions
will be executed if the user meets the security criteria, otherwise execution is
aborted. The plugin assumes sensible defaults where needed but also lets you
customize behavior.

Refer to the link:http://griffon-plugins.github.io/{project-name}/[plugin guide, window="_blank"] for
further information on configuration and usage.
